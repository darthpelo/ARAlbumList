ARAlbumList
===========

Exercise to test AFNetworking 2.0 and UITableview (async download, fast scrolling etc)

The application display a number of videos descriptions from a feed in a scrolling list. 
￼The feed load more elements automatically as soon as the user reaches the
￼end of the current list

I use Vimeo’s public API, so there is no need to implement authentication. Specification is located on the following [URL](https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/simple#album-request-url). By adding the ?page parameter to the URL, you can retrieve up pages of data.
